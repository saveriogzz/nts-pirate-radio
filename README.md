# NTS Radio for Raspberry Pi

Stream NTS Radio (live channels + infinite mixtapes) on a Raspberry Pi with a Pimoroni Pirate Audio Line-out HAT. Deployed via Balena Cloud.

[![balena deploy button](https://www.balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/saveriogzz/nts-balena)

## What you need

- A Raspberry Pi with a 40-pin header — Zero 2W recommended; Pi 2/3/4/5 also supported
- [Pimoroni Pirate Audio Line-out](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pirate-audio-line-out) — ST7789 240x240 display, 4 buttons, I2S DAC (other Pirate Audio variants with the same DAC work too)
- A microSD card (4 GB or larger) and power supply
- A free [balenaCloud](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/signup) account (up to 10 devices)

**Assembly:** seat the Pirate Audio HAT on the Pi's 40-pin header before powering on. No soldering or wiring — the HAT is the only hardware configuration there is.

## Getting started (one-click)

1. Click the **Deploy with balena** button above and sign in to balenaCloud.
2. Review the fleet settings and click **Create and deploy**. Everything is preconfigured from `balena.yml` — SPI, the I2S DAC overlay, and default environment variables. No dashboard setup needed.
3. Click **Add device**, enter your Wi-Fi credentials, and download the OS image.
4. Flash the image to the SD card with [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), insert it, and power on.

On first boot the device downloads the application (a few minutes depending on your connection), the display shows **NTS RADIO — Starting up...**, and channel 1 starts playing automatically.

### Manual deploy (balena CLI)

Create a fleet on [Balena Cloud](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com) (device type **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** or any supported model), then:

```bash
balena login
balena push <fleet-name>
```

## Controls

| Button | Playing | Menu |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| A (top-left) | Previous channel/mixtape | Scroll up |
| B (bottom-left) | Next channel/mixtape | Scroll down |
| X (top-right) | Play/Pause | Select |
| Y (bottom-right) | Open menu | Back |

## Screens

- **Live** — NTS 1 / NTS 2 with show artwork, title, and progress bar
- **Mixtapes** — Browse and play all NTS infinite mixtapes
- **Menu** — Switch between live radio and mixtapes

## Configuration

All settings are optional. These are set as fleet defaults in `balena.yml` and can be overridden per-fleet or per-device in the balenaCloud dashboard (Environment Variables):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NTS_DEFAULT_CHANNEL` | `1` | Start on channel 1 or 2 |
| `NTS_DISPLAY_BRIGHTNESS` | `80` | Backlight brightness 0-100 |
| `NTS_BUTTON_DEBOUNCE_MS` | `200` | Button debounce in ms |

The hardware configuration (SPI, `hifiberry-dac` device tree overlay, onboard audio off) is applied automatically via the fleet's configuration variables — you'll find it under **Fleet → Configuration** in the dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

- **No audio** — check the HAT is fully seated on the header. Then check **Fleet → Configuration** in the dashboard includes the `hifiberry-dac` overlay (set automatically when deploying with the button); the device reboots when configuration changes.
- **Blank display** — also a seating issue in most cases; the display needs SPI, which the same fleet configuration enables.
- **Stuck on "Loading..."** — the device has no route to `www.nts.live`. Check the network; the app needs outbound HTTPS. Audio can play before metadata appears — that's normal on a slow connection.
- **Buttons do nothing** — the app expects the Pirate Audio buttons on BCM pins 5, 6, 16, 24. Other button HATs won't map.
- Device logs are available in the balenaCloud dashboard for anything else.

## Local development

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Tests run on any machine — the GPIO, display, and mpv layers are mocked, and the hardware dependencies live behind an optional `hw` extra that only the Pi installs:

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

The app version is tracked in one place: the `version` field in `balena.yml`, which balena uses to version releases.

For running on a Pi directly without Balena, `install.sh` and `nts-radio.service` set it up as a systemd service on Raspberry Pi OS.
